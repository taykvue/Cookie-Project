        <p class="p" id="Untitled__f65d">Creativity represents an idea that uses the imagination of an artist and is
            original. One can expect creativity to aid their imagination to create something
            different, unique, and unconventional. In the Creative Design Methods class I took, we
            were tasked to make a creative cookie. For this cookie design, I wanted to make
            something that is creative and does not look, taste, or smell like any conventional,
            ordinary cookie. However there are rules that I did follow to ensure that this cookie is
            edible, delicious, and visually pleasing. </p>
        <p class="p" id="Untitled__ee96">Ordinary cookies are usually round and brown in color. I decided to follow the
            round shape but added in small legs to make the cookie design look like a turtle. Adding
            in the green tea matcha also made my cookie green in color. </p>
        <p class="p" id="Untitled__3a9f">Taste is important. Cookies are usually made to be sweet, savory, crispy or
            soft to the touch. The Turtle Coconut Matcha cookie was made to be soft, sweet, with a
            hint of a variety of flavors including green tea matcha, purple sweet potato, coconut,
            citrus flavors, cocoa, and ginger. With these overwhelming flavors mixed together, I was
            skeptical of it’s aftertaste, but it turned out to be delicious and pleasant with it’s
            combination of flavors.</p>
        <p class="p" id="Untitled__5136">The aroma of the cookie fresh out of the oven is refreshing. Although it does
            have the scent of a standard cookies, it also have other incorporated smells from the
            variety of added flavors. Flavors from cocoa powder, citrus lemon and orange, as well as
            green tea matcha gives the cookie a unique smell.</p>
