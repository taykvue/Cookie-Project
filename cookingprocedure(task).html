                        ginger crystals) in a bowl under boiling water (be cautious of hot bowl)
                        until it reaches temperature of 160 Fahrenheit, feel the texture to see if
                        the sugar has dissolved using your fingers, if it’s grainy, then it’s not
                        ready.</li>
                    <li class="li">When the wet ingredient mixture is cooled down, pour mixture into a food
                        processor and process the wet ingredients for 2 minutes or until the mixture
                        is smooth and homogeneous.</li>

                        another bowl and carefully mix the ingredients together with a spatula.</li>
                    <li class="li">Pour the wet ingredients onto dry ingredients, and mix thoroughly, then
                        place a plastic wrap on top of it and leave the dough in the fridge for 30
                        minutes.</li>
                    <li class="li">Make the filling base by adding all of the base ingredients, excluding the
                        Medjool dates, into a bowl and stir the mixture using same method as
                        described above, then when mixture has cooled down, pour the mixture into
                        the food processor, add the Medjool dates (that has been pitted, seeds
                        removed, and warmed, using lukewarm water), and process it for 3–5 minutes,
                        or until mixture is smooth and homogeneous.</li>
                    <li class="li">Make the cocoa filling by adding the cocoa powder to half of the batter
                        filling and purple sweet potato filling by adding the purple sweet potato
                        powder to the other half of the batter fillings.</li>
                    <li class="li">Form the dough into a ball the core fillings (cocoa) and sweet potato
                        filling, (covering core cocoa powder filling) then form the legs of the
                        turtle and head, and place the ball on top of the bottom body of the legs
                        and head structure.</li>
                    <li class="li">Before baking, put the batch in the freezer for 15 minutes while preheating
                        the oven at 350 Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li class="li">Bake for 10–12 minutes or until the cookie is cooked.</li>
                    <li class="li">After cooking, smear a tablespoon of sweet potato filling on top of the
                        shell of turtle, and sprinkle coconut flakes.</li>
